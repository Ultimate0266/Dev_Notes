    <p>What is a map method and how does it work? The map method is a powerful and widely used function in JavaScript that operates on arrays. It's designed to create a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original array. This method does not modify the original array, but instead returns the new array containing the results of the function applied to each element.</p>
